====================================================================================================================================================================================

How to run the program?
Run the executable named Main with the input filename as an argument.
Eg: ./Main <input file name>
====================================================================================================================================================================================

Output:
Generates the output file as <input file name>_gen.scala
For example, the input file is 1.scala, the output file is 1_gen.scala.
Prints Error if the input grammar is not accepted by the Scanner or Parser.

The three test cases are 1.scala, 2.scala, 3.scala. The transformed codes are 1_gen.scala, 2_gen.scala, 3.scala. You can enter the paste mode of Spark shell and input the original test code and the transformed code separately. The results should be the same.

For example, you paste 1.scala code into Spark shell, then exit the paste mode and get the result. Then enter the paste mode again and paste 1_gen.scala code. The result should be the same.
