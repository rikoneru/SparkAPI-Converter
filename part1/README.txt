The test cases for Part 1 are 1.scala, 2.scala and 3.scala.

To compile it, the command is 
javac *.java

to execute it and generate the transformed code for a test case:
java Scanner <inputFileName>

An example is:
java Scanner 1.scala

Or you can use the Makefile to execute the above commands. The three test codes are generated by only typing "make" in your terminal.

The output code has the an extension of _gen for the original file name of the test case. For example, if the input test case is 1.scala, the output transformed code is in 1_gen.scala.

After generating the output, you can enter the Spark shell and paste the code to check the two codes output the same results. Don't forget to paste the content of helpers.scala.txt under the Spark shell before testing.

For example, when you enter the Spark shell, type in :paste to enter paste mode. Then paste the code of original test code 1.scala. Exit the paste mode and Spark begin to interpret the test code. You can check the result of 1.scala. Then enter the paste mode again and paste the transformed code 1_gen.scala. Exit and check the result of 1_gen.scala. They should be the same.
